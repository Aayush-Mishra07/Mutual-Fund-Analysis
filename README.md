# Mutual-Fund-Analysis
This repository contains various approaches to shortlist Indian Mutual Funds particularly from the all the large Cap Equity funds.
This was a part of my mutual fund research during my summer internship at Bonanza Portfolio Ltd.

## Process
1.Read about the basics of Mutual Fund working model,modes of investment,terms like NFO,NAV,etc. 
2.Understood various parameters used to analyse a mutual fund like Sharpe,Jensen's Alpha,Expense Ratio,Treynor Ratio,Sortino,Returns,beta,etc.
3.Decided weights on those parameters and eventually rank them based on a cumulative score.
4.Take the large cap funds dataset and implement the idea using python.

## Help from Mentors
For this analysis,These were the mentors at Bonanza who guided me:Mr.Achin Goel,Mr. Vishal Gupta,Mr. Nitin Mishra.
The data source used in this was provided by Mr.Vishal.
